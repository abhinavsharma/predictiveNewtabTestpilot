Predictive Newtab for Firefox
======================

The Idea
--------

Firefox does not currently implement a "speed-dial" to help you get to popular websites quickly. This add-on takes the idea of a "speed-dial" and extends it. It looks at the tabs you are currently browsing, and makes recommendations based on what you are currently viewing when you open a new tab. This is not meant to replace a speed-dial but instead supplement it. Also, it acts as a potential front end for developing a better search engine for Firefox history and other components.

Features
--------

There are two branches, with each taking a different approach to predictions

+ allsearch - This one works by collecting tags from your current browsing session and running a search for similar content in your Firefox history.
+ jumptracker - This one works by installing a tracker to track what hosts you jump between the most and recommends based on that information.
